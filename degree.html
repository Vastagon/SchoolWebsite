    <ul>
        <li>Degrees are slowly becoming less required in certain jobs. One of the job fields furthest along into this is computer science/programming. It can make the job search more difficult, but it is possible.</li>
        <li>No matter which way you go to learn, whether it's going to school, to a coding bootcamp, or self-taught, at the end of the day, every programmer is self-taught. These different forms of learning are just tools</li>
        <li>Getting an interview is going to be harder without a degree, but anybody that you'd actually want to work for focus a lot more on an applicant's projects and github profile, than what degree they have</li>
        <li>Once I manage to land the first job, if I had a degree then it's essentially diminishing returns from that point forward. In the tech industry, after your first job and when you have experience, employers value that far more than a degree due to the fact that on the job experience is how you become a good programmer. Classes only do so much.</li>
